A four-legged spider robot powered by an Arduino Nano. This project utilizes a PCA9685 servo driver to control 8 servo motors, enabling a variety of movements that can be controlled via Bluetooth using a smartphone.

## Demo

Here are some images and GIFs of the spider robot in action:

**Example:**

*Caption: The spider is happy.*

## Features

* **Bluetooth Control:** Wirelessly control the robot using the Dabble app on a smartphone.
* **Dynamic Movements:** Capable of walking forward and turning left or right.
* **Special Actions:** Pre-programmed actions like a "happy dance," "defense mode," and a "pull-up" motion.
* **Scalable Design:** The PCA9685 driver supports up to 16 channels, leaving room for future expansion.

## Software and Dependencies

This project relies on the Arduino IDE and several libraries.

1. **Arduino IDE:** [Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. **Required Libraries:**
    * `Wire` (Built-in)
    * `SoftwareSerial` (Built-in)
    * [Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)
    * [Dabble Library](https://thestempedia.com/docs/dabble/arduino-ide-installation/)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Assemble Hardware:** Connect all components as shown in the wiring diagram. Ensure the external power supply for the servos is correctly connected.
2. **Install Libraries:** Open the Arduino IDE and install the required libraries via the Library Manager.
3. **Upload Code:** Flash the main control code to your Arduino Nano.

    ```bash
    spider-robot/main/main.ino
    ```

4. **Install Dabble App:** Install the [Dabble](https://thestempedia.com/product/dabble) application on your smartphone.
5. **Pair Bluetooth:** Power on the robot and pair your smartphone with the `JDY-33` Bluetooth module.
6. **Connect in App:** Open the Dabble app, connect to the robot, and select the Gamepad module.

## How to Use

1. **Power On:** Turn on the robot. It will assume its default idle position.
2. **Connect:** Launch the Dabble app and establish a connection with the robot.
3. **Control:** Use the gamepad interface to control the robot's movements and actions.

### Control Scheme

| Dabble Input | Robot Action | Function Called |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Up Arrow** | Move Forward | `moveForward()` |
| **Left Arrow** | Turn Left | `turnLeft()` |
| **Right Arrow** | Turn Right | `turnRight()` |
| **Triangle** | Happy Dance | `happyAction()` |
| **Cross** | Defense Mode | `defenseAction()` |
| **Circle** | Pull-up | `pullUpAction()` |
| *(No Input)* | Idle Position | `idle()` |

## Calibration and Debugging

If the robot's movements are erratic, you may need to calibrate the servos.

1. **Upload Debug Sketch:** Flash the `debug/debug.ino` file to the Arduino Nano.
2. **Open Serial Monitor:** Set the baud rate to `9600`.
3. **Send Commands:** Test each servo individually by sending commands in the format `<servo_number> <angle>`.
    * Example: `1 90` sets servo 1 to a 90-degree angle.
    * Use command `8` to reset all servos to the idle position (45Â°).

### Servo Mappings for Debugging

| Servo Number | Joint Assignment |
| :---: | :--- |
| `0` | FRONT_LEFT_HIP |
| `1` | FRONT_LEFT_KNEE |
| `2` | FRONT_RIGHT_HIP |
| `3` | FRONT_RIGHT_KNEE |
| `4` | BACK_LEFT_HIP |
| `5` | BACK_LEFT_KNEE |
| `6` | BACK_RIGHT_HIP |
| `7` | BACK_RIGHT_KNEE |
